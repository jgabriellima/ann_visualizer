# Visualizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
#### with just One Line of Code


ANN Visualizer is a python library that enables us to visualize an Artificial Neural Network using just a single line of code. It is used to work with Keras and makes use of python’s graphviz library to create a neat and presentable graph of the neural network you’re building.

## Installation

We will need 3 libraries for this demo

- keras
- ANNvisualizer
- graphviz

You can install the library using the below commands:

```
$ pip3 install keras
$ pip3 install ann_visualizer
$ pip install graphviz
$ pip install h5py

```
